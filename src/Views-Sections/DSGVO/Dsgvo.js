        <p className={styles["paragraphs"]}>
          We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise.
          Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management
          of the Dresden Psych Family e.V.. The use of the Internet pages of the
          Dresden Psych Family e.V. is possible without any indication of
          personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special
          enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could
          become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and
          there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain
          consent from the data subject.
        </p>

        <p className={styles["paragraphs"]}>
          The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
          address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line
          with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance
          with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to
          the Dresden Psych Family e.V.. By means of this data protection
          declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of
          the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use
          and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this
          data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
        </p>

        <p className={styles["paragraphs"]}>
          As the controller, the Dresden Psych Family e.V. has implemented
          numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most
          complete protection of personal data processed through this website.
          However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have
          security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this
          reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via
          alternative means, e.g. by telephone.

          declaration should be legible and understandable for the general
          public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure
          this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.

        </h5>

        <p className={styles["paragraphs"]}>
          The website of the Dresden Psych Family e.V. collects a series of
          general data and information when a data subject or automated system
          calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in
          the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and
          versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system,
          (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website
          (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of
          access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP
          address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system,
          and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the
          event of attacks on our information technology systems.
        </p>

        <p className={styles["paragraphs"]}>
          When using these general data and information, the Dresden Psych
          Family e.V. does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.
          Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our
          website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as
          its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our
          information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide
          law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for
          criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Dresden
          Psych Family e.V. analyzes anonymously collected data and information
          statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data
          security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of
          protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the
          server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided
          by a data subject.

          4. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data

          The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the
          data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of
          storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or
          other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is
          subject to.

          accordance with legal requirements.
